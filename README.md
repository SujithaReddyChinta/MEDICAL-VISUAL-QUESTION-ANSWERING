Medical Visual Question Answering (MVQA) is a rapidly evolving field that combines computer vision and natural language processing to answer questions related to medical images. 
MVQA aims to help healthcare professionals in making informed decisions by automating the analysis and interpretation of medical images. 
In this field, the input to the system is a medical image and a natural language question related to the image, and the output is a text-based answer to the question. 
The development of MVQA systems requires expertise in computer vision, natural language processing, and medical knowledge, and can have a significant impact on the field of medical imaging and diagnosis.
